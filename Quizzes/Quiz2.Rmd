## 1.-

Suppose I define the following function in R

``` {r eval=FALSE}

cube <- function(x, n) {
        x^3
}

```

What is the result of running `cube(3)` in R after defining this function?


- The number 27 is returned  (Correct)

- An error is returned because 'n' is not specified in the call to 'cube'

- A warning is given with no value returned.

- The users is prompted to specify the value of 'n'.


Solution -> 

``` {r prove_1}
cube <- function(x, n) {
        x^3
}
cube(3)
```


## 2.-

The following code will produce a warning in R.

``` {r eval=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
if(x > 5) {
        x <- 0
}
```
Why?


- The syntax of this R expression is incorrect.

- The expression uses curly braces.

- You cannot set 'x' to be 0 because 'x' is a vector and 0 is a scalar.  

- 'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement.  (Correct)

- There are no elements in 'x' that are greater than 5

Solution -> The response itself.


## 3.-

Consider the following function

``` {r eval=FALSE}
f <- function(x) {
        g <- function(y) {
                y + z
        }
        z <- 4
        x + g(x)
}
```
If I then run in R `z <- 10; f(3)`

What value is returned?

- 4

- 16

- 10   (Correct)

- 7

Solution -> 

``` {r prove_3}
f <- function(x) {
        g <- function(y) {
                y + z
        }
        z <- 4
        x + g(x)
}
z <- 10; f(3)
```


## 4.-

Consider the following expression:

``` {r eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
y <- if(x < 3) {
        NA
} else {
        10
}
```

What is the value of 'y' after evaluating this expression?

- 5

- 10  (Correct)

- 3

- NA

Solution -> 

``` {r prove_4}
x <- 5
y <- if(x < 3) {
        NA
} else {
        10
}
y
```

## 5.-

Consider the following R function

``` {r eval=FALSE}
h <- function(x, y = NULL, d = 3L) {
        z <- cbind(x, d)
        if(!is.null(y))
                z <- z + y
        else
                z <- z + f
        g <- x + y / z
        if(d == 3L)
                return(g)
        g <- g + 10
        g
}
```

Which symbol in the above function is a free variable?


- f  (Correct)

- z

- d

- L

- g

Solution -> f is not an argument and it is not defined in function

## 6.-

What is an environment in R?

- a special type of function

- a collection of symbol/value pairs  (Correct)

- a list whose elements are all functions

- an R package that only contains data

Solution -> Theory.

## 7.-

The R language uses what type of scoping rule for resolving free variables?

- lexical scoping  (Correct)

- compilation scoping

- dynamic scoping

- global scoping

Solution -> Theory

## 8.-

How are free variables in R functions resolved?

- The values of free variables are searched for in the global environment

- The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was called

- The values of free variables are searched for in the working directory

- The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined  (Correct)

Solution -> Theory

## 9.-

What is one of the consequences of the scoping rules used in R?

- Functions cannot be nested

- R objects cannot be larger than 100 MB

- All objects can be stored on the disk

- All objects must be stored in memory  (Correct)

Solution -> Theory

## 10.-

In R, what is the parent frame?

- It is always the global environment

- It is the environment in which a function was called  (Correct)

- It is the environment in which a function was defined

- It is the package search list

Solution -> Theory
